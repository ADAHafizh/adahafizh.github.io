## Description 

##### Development Time: 2 Weeks

I came across HOT (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) during my work as a research assistant on campus. HOT is an international team dedicated to humanitarian action and community development through open mapping. They work to provide map data which revolutionises disaster management, reduces risks, and contributes to achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.

For this project, I intend to create a layered timeline progressive interactive map. In other words, I would like to display a map that the user can 'play around' with the different settings that allows broader range of interpretations. 

Thus, this project is a culmination and display some skills that I have learned throughout my time as a researcher.

## Processes

##### Data Collection

Originally, I wanted to use UNOSAT's comprehensive data regarding the different types of layers they provide (i.e population, agriculture). However, a major challenge that I encountered was that the data they provided were in the form of GDTable, which was incompatible with the tool I intend to use: [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/demo)

> **Hence, for the data, I extracted it from HOTOSM's [Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org/v3/exports/new).**

##### Examining the Data
