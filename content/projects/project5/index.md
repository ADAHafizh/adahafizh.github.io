## Intended Gameplay

Two players use WASD and Arrow Keys to control the characters. 
+ This control scheme emphasizes the game's focus on teamwork and communication, as players must coordinate their actions closely to solve puzzles and advance the story. The dual-player mode is essential for the narrative and mechanics of "Soulmates". 

Players are encouraged to work together in real-time, making decisions that affect the game's outcome. 
+ This setup enhances the game's thematic elements of companionship and togetherness, providing a unique interactive experience. 

These two aspects are central to the concept of "Soulmates", ensuring players can experience the full depth of the game's cooperative and storytelling potential.

## Development: LEVEL DESIGN

##### Brainstorming Phase 

> The development of "Soulmates" started by defining a clear vision: to create a cooperative puzzle-solving game that emphasized storytelling. The core idea was to intertwine the game mechanics with the narrative, making each puzzle a part of the unfolding story about two souls discovering their past. 

> As such, cooperation is mandatory with puzzles that cannot be solved by players acting independently. This enforces the theme of togetherness and mutual dependence. The game is set in a limbo-like world, chosen for its symbolic representation of the characters' state — between their past lives and their potential redemption. This setting supports the narrative. The decision was influenced by the desire to create a space that felt both mysterious and engaging, encouraging exploration and cooperation.

As the one in charge of designing the levels, I envision 'progressive' stages to the gameplay experience. What I mean by this is that there is a **curve where the players transition from a simple gameplay to more challenging puzzles.**

The general idea of each chapter is laid out as such: 
+ **Chapter I:** The introductory level, here, the players are introduced to the playable characters (Dark and Light spirits), control schemes, platformer, and lore. 
+ **Chapter II:** I expect by this point players are quite 'familiar' with the gameplay loop. Here, I introduce more mechanics to the game, such as grappling hooks, ladders, anti-gravity zones. The focus on this chapter is an emphasis on full cooperative puzzle solving. 
+ **Chapter III:**
