## Description 

##### Development Time: 4 Weeks

Just A Racing Game is a single-player racing game made with Unity. The game is heavily inspired by your favorite racing games such as Asetto Corsa, Forza, and Need for Speed titles. 

+ Explore three distinct circuits with different cars, each with its own specifications!
+ Background music provided by PigeonScruff!
+ Achieve your best time within three laps to secure a victory!
+ 
The game was developed as my first video game project for New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) Interactive Media program class: Games and Play, lectured by taught by [Domna Banakou](https://domnabanakou.com/).

## Intended Gameplay

Players use WASD and SPACEBAR to control the cars. They have to reach the finish line after few laps within the time limit to finish. A scoreboard is presented after finishing a race. Players can also race bots.

## Development

##### Brainstorming Phase 

I wanted to create a simple racing game, that's it. This was my very first take on Unity and the tranasition from Unreal Engine workflow to Unity was an interesting process. Alas, I wanted to push how much I could design the race tracks, car physics, and aesthetics in general. 

+ I chose low poly designs because it aligns with the simplicty aspect 

##### Programming Phase

Instead of using the racing kit template provided by the class, I chose to 'reinvent' the wheel and start from scratch. The work is split between a few things:

+ Car physics & controller
+ Sound manager
+ Logic systems (timer, finish line, track points)

##### Shortcomings

Because of the tight deadlines, I was unable to actualize the AI versus system. But from this project, I learned the basics of Unity which also serve as the building blocks for future projects. 

## Conclusion & Insights 

I got an A for this project, pretty satisfied.
