### What is Digital Literacy? üìñ
It is a person's ability to read and engage a digital media or platform. Reading here is beyond understanding textual information (i.e alphabets), but more so towards finding, navigating, evaluating, and communicating information contained within the media. Engaging is to use that information and process it: *"I've read this post on Instagram, what can I learn from it?*" or *"I want to go on a vacation to location X, where are the cool spots. Should I begin searching reviews on forums, or look at place reviews on (a digital) map?"* Such spark in the person's mind is a result of the person's ability to digest informations stored within a digital media and process it to produce a desirable outcome. 

### (To be) Literate üí¨
A person's digital literacy partially is influenced by their proficiency in computational thinking. Berry (2017) emphasizes this term as "a cognitive practice  developed through a practical wisdom that emerges from action [of knowing how to do things]." When confronted by a digital media, a person is considered literate when they take procedural steps, as Berry suggest, 'algorithmic' and 'computational' (that is like a computer) to digest the information. In its essence, to be considered digital literate, a person requires both technical proficiency and critical reflection to engage with digital materials.
Berry emphasizes that computational thinking is a critical skill for digital humanities, thus digital literacy. It combines technical literacy with reflective critique, enabling scholars to navigate and shape the computational landscape of modern research

### Subconsciously Like A Computer üñ•Ô∏è

![IG Post](/assets/images/igpost.png)

> One thing that I noticed as I went on with the class (reflecting on the practices and assignments), is that mayhaps, **being born as a person (part of a certain generation) that is constantly bathed, exposed, and breathed in digital media, my brain have automatically 'compute' in order for me to be able to read digital information.**

For example, leaning back to the activity of reading Instagram post, what are the steps that my brain have subconsciously ran in order for me to understand this piece of information?
 - First and foremost, I know that this information is presented in a digital machine: be it a phone or computer.
 - Second, it is a digital media. There are no physical properties such as paper print. 
 - Third, the text is accompanied by a digital image. Both the text and image are contained within a 'post', an information visualization form. 
 - Fourth and so forth, based on the informations presented here, there are more steps that I can take. By *navigating* the digital screen, I can 'like', 'share', or 'comment', distinct actions that I could perform based on experience (*practical wisdom: I know what button or icon to press because previously I tried pressing on them and it prompted me for an action*).  
The steps above are subconsciously running in my mind when I come across digital information. I believe, my exposure to digital media since early childhood developed a deep understanding of how to operate, read, and engage with the materials.

**Then, what does it mean for me to be fluent in digital literacy?** As a 20-year-old university student at a liberal arts institution, I find myself at the intersection of digital fluency and critical inquiry. Both aspect are important for me to look at both sides of the picture. It allows me to look at an information and take my time to think: *"Is this relevant?"* or *"What opinion does the other side have?"* or "*Based on this information, what can I learn from it?*" In essence, I am being responsible for everything that I stumble across in present-day digital world. 

### Tinkering my Texts ‚öíÔ∏è
What does it mean to process the digital information? Before we talk about processing digital information, let's begin by talking about digital humanities. 
>In simple terms, **a digital humanities work is the practice of using computational methods with human materials**. The research materials may be analog or born digital, and the integration with computational methods depends upon decisions at every stage of a project‚Äôs design (Drucker 2021). 

The article above specifically mentions of working from a non-digitized materials to a digital form.The work is categorized in three components: **Materials**, that are converted to digital forms. **Process**, the use of computational tools and methods to extract data from the materials. Lastly, **Presentation**, to display the outcome in a human manner, typically done using websites. 

In class, we learned new frontiers on processing humanities materials to a digital form, and apply our understanding of digital literacy to it. As an example, Voyant Tools is one of the tools that we learnt which allows us to read materials without having to closely read with the materials beforehand. This practice is considered '**distant reading**', a practice of reading that gathers large amounts of materials and use computational tools (such as Voyant) to produce textual analysis of these texts (Adwetewa-Badu 2022).

For me, in the context of academics, distant reading has helped me create a context mind map of my class readings. After having closely read them, by using Voyant Tools, I was able to gain general context of all the reading we've done so far. In exchange, I was also able to see small information that I might have missed during my close reading. 

### Digital Literacy in Content Creation and Social Interaction

Digital literacy informs how I engage with content creation and social interaction. For instance, as a Literature and Creative Writing major, I use platforms like Medium and Substack to publish essays, engage with communities of writers, and receive constructive feedback. My peers in Film and New Media might be adept at using Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve for video editing, while those studying Interactive Media might be creating augmented reality experiences or designing user interfaces with Figma. Regardless of discipline, we all rely on digital platforms to distribute our work, communicate with audiences, and collaborate with others.

Social interaction is similarly shaped by digital fluency. Tools like Discord, Slack, and Trello facilitate collaborative academic projects and extracurricular activities. While I might use Instagram or TikTok to share creative writing snippets or engage with literature-focused communities, my peers in Art History might curate digital exhibitions on platforms like Google Arts & Culture. Understanding the affordances and limitations of these platforms is a crucial skill‚Äîone that extends beyond social engagement to how we construct and critique digital narratives.

### Digital Research and Data Management

Managing and analyzing research data is another essential component of digital literacy. For example, I use Zotero to organize citations for literary analysis papers, while my friends in Computer Science might use GitHub for version control in coding projects. My peers in Art and Art History rely on databases like JSTOR and Artstor for research, while those in Interactive Media might employ Unity or Unreal Engine to prototype interactive experiences. Understanding how to efficiently manage digital information not only improves research efficiency but also fosters critical engagement with sources.

Moreover, data manipulation and analysis have become integral to various disciplines. I have experimented with Voyant Tools to conduct textual analysis of literary works, uncovering hidden patterns in large corpora of texts. Meanwhile, my peers in Computer Science use Python and R for data visualization, and those in Film and New Media analyze audience engagement metrics using Google Analytics. Each discipline has its own toolkit, yet digital humanities offer a bridge between them, demonstrating how computational approaches can enrich our understanding of literature, art, and media.

### Digital Humanities and New Horizons in Learning

The field of digital humanities provides an interdisciplinary space where traditional humanistic inquiry meets computational methods. Before taking courses in digital humanities, I viewed textual analysis as a primarily close-reading endeavor. However, through exposure to machine learning models for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, I have begun to see literature not just as a collection of individual texts but as part of larger, analyzable systems. Digital humanities expand what is possible in my field, from network analysis of characters in novels to computational studies of authorship attribution.

This exposure has also deepened my understanding of computational thinking, as described by Berry and Fagerjord‚Äînot just as programming but as a cognitive practice that involves practical wisdom and reflection on computation itself. In collaborative settings, my peers and I negotiate different approaches to problems: a computer science student might suggest algorithmic sorting for a dataset, while a literature student like myself might emphasize the ethical implications of data collection. These interdisciplinary discussions challenge us to develop nuanced perspectives on digital methods, recognizing both their potential and their limitations.

### Onwards and Beyond üéØ

(March 2025)
After having exposed to new digital research tools, I realize that there are more ways to engage with digital information than just 'read' them, literally. One of the common goals of Digital Arts and Humanities work is in the realms of digitatlization + preservation of analog materials. We learned how *tedious* and consuming work for researchers to be able to digitize these materials. But in doing so, we are also presented with a dilemma: **as we process materials further and further, we are bound to 'wash off' some of its properties, potentially degrading its intention and meaning in the future.**

Despite my growing proficiency in digital research tools, I recognize gaps in my understanding. While I am comfortable with basic text mining and visualization techniques, I would like to develop deeper expertise in natural language processing and data storytelling. AI presents new frontiers in creative writing, from generative text models to interactive storytelling experiences, and I am curious about how these tools can be critically and creatively engaged.

Additionally, I want to explore the ethical dimensions of digital work. How do biases in AI systems shape the way information is processed and disseminated? We learned in class that different AI, depending on their training, does result in different political stances. How can we ensure that digital tools do not reinforce systemic inequalities in academia and beyond? Digital literacy is not just about technical proficiency but about developing a critical lens through which to evaluate digital systems and their impact on society. **It also means that as new technology is introduced to society, we have to be responsible on its uses both as a user and a developer.**

### Conclusion
As I continue my journey through university, I am excited to deepen my engagement with digital humanities and computational thinking. Digital literacy is not a static skill set but an evolving practice that requires constant learning and adaptation. By embracing interdisciplinary collaboration, critically reflecting on digital tools, and exploring new ways of approaching data, I hope to cultivate a digital fluency that is both technically sound and ethically informed. The liberal arts, with their emphasis on holistic learning, provide the perfect environment for this exploration‚Äîone where the humanities and technology do not stand in opposition but work together to enrich our understanding of the world.
